             <p>
                 Everyday in our lives we face so many decision making situations and most of them are faced alone. We find ourselves bewildered amongst the zillions of perspective and we are not sure anymore of our own better judgment.

             </p>
             <p>
                 Many students give up their goals due to lack of proper career guidance. Thousands of people go through wrong or unnecessarily long treatment due to lack of proper medical consultation. Not everybody can reach good and relevant lawyers to process their legal cases.

<h2><u>Our Conception Story</u> <br>
How we inspire and get inspired!
</h2>
<p>
    Mr Jeetesh Kumar, an MICA alumni, had always wanted to be a part of the greater good and be the cause of a remarkable shift in people's well-being. He also had an undeniable interest in being actively associated with a startup and bring a marked change in the way this society serves its people. He decided to abandon his flourishing career to work for society’s welfare. He possesses a unique way of perceiving and contemplating what he sees. During his MBA Mr Kumar observed the problems that arise in people's life due to lack of reachability to proper guidance. His outspread vision prompted him to take an initiatory step of his own in order to bring people closer to the right kind of advisers. On February 1st, 2017 he inaugurated Adviceli with some great intentions. We are growing with a vision of enhancing the way people Search, Ask & Shop. Our Motto being that “Nobody in the world should suffer due to lack of guidance”.
